        <p class="enNegrita tituloA">Re: Eileen Dover university application</p>

        <p>Dear Eileen,<br><br>

            Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br>
            of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
        </p>

        <p class="enNegrita tituloB">Starting dates</p>

        <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br>
        could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>First semester: <time datetime="2016-09-09">9 September 2016</time></li>
            <li>Second semester: <time datetime="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</time></li>
            <li>Third semester: <time datetime="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</time></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>

        <p>You can find more information about <a href="#">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>

        <p class="enNegrita tituloB">Subjects of study</p>

        <p>
        At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility -- as long as the subjects fall<br>
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br>
        the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>
        by are as follows, in order of priority:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when th<br>
                audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
            <li>HTML and CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the<br>
        research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
        </p>


        <p class="enNegrita tituloB">Exotic dance moves</p>

        Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <h class="enCursiva">did</h> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>
        my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
        <br><br>
        Polynesian chicken dance<br>
            <div class="corridaDer">A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around<br>
                in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</div>
        Icelandic brownian shuffle
            <div class="corridaDer">Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br>
                involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly<br>
                tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br>
                modern styles such as Twerking.</div>
        Arctic robot dance
            <div class="corridaDer">An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br>
                discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br>
                of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br>
                because they were really cold.</div>
        <br>
        For more of my research, see my <a href="#">exotic dance research page</a>
        <br><br>
        Yours sincerely,<br><br><br><br><br>
